##Installation:

Merge the GameData folder in the zip file with the GameData folder in your KSP root directory.  Deleting the TheCollidersStrikeBack directory in GameData will uninstall TCSB

------------------
##What it does:

This disables an optimization / improvement made early in KSP's history that disabled all intra-vessel part collisions.  
Parts will not collide with themselves (to avoid issues with landing gear or cargo bays that are dependent on this functioning well), but will collide with other parts on the vessel.  
This can be used for experiments into the nature of collisions, avoid issues with payloads clipping through payload fairings / cargo bays, and general mayhem.

###Warning:

This has the capacity to destroy any vehicle that includes part clipping as an integral part of the design.  Any and all vehicles launched / created before this was installed may spontaneously explode if they are dependent on intra-vessel collisions being disabled.
