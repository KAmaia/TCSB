##What it does:

This Reenables Collisions between parts on a vessel that do not share a joint.  Many thanks go out to Ferram4 for creating the original version of this mod at https://github.com/ferram4/TCSB 

As it currently stands, this mod works, but checks enumerates the parts list each frame, which is expensive, and causes performance to drop.


###Warning:

This has the capacity to destroy any vehicle that includes part clipping as an integral part of the design.  Any and all vehicles launched / created before this was installed may spontaneously explode if they are dependent on intra-vessel collisions being disabled.
